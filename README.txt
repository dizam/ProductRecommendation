Kaggle competition for a Machine Learning Project.
The machine learning programs were developed in python and can be run as python scripts (they were converted to txt files for ease of reading the code).

My job specifically on this team was to help develop the collaborative filtering machine learning model, and I developed the MAP (mean average prediction) parser code myself. The reason for developing the parser code was because resubmissions for testing on Kaggle took too long since they were time limited, so we decided to develop the parser to quickly test code and gain a better understanding of the accuracy of our models in the report.
